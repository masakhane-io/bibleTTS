#### Alignment methodology

1. [Segmentation using existing verse timestamps](https://github.com/coqui-ai/open-bible-scripts) (Sec 4.1.1)
2. [Forced alignment using pre-trained acoustic models](https://github.com/alpoktem/bible2speechDB) (Sec 4.1.2)
3. [Forced alignment from scratch](https://github.com/coqui-ai/open-bible-scripts) (Sec 4.1.3)

#### Outlier detection

- [Data-checker](https://github.com/coqui-ai/data-checker) code for outlier detection (Sec 4.2)

#### TTS model training

- VITS TTS models were trained with [coqui-ai](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) (Sec 5)
